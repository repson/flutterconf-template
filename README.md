<h1 align="center">Flutter Everywhere!</h2>

This Flutter projects acts as a boilerplate to create true universal apps from a single codebase.

Currently, the Flutter frameworks supports these platforms:
* Android
* iOS
* Windows
* macOS
* GNU+Linux
* Web (Chrome only)

## Getting started

In order to build & deploy apps to specific, just run:

```
$ flutter build android|ios|windows|macos|linux|web
```

If want you really want is to test the app, first run `flutter devices` to check connected devices. Then, you'll have to run:

```
$ flutter run -d DEVICE
```

## Download & install
First, clone the repository with the 'clone' command, or just download the zip.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:jesusrp98/flutter-everywhere.git
```

Then, download either Android Studio or Visual Studio Code, with their respective [Flutter editor plugins](https://flutter.io/get-started/editor/). For more information about Flutter installation procedure, check the [official install guide](https://flutter.io/get-started/install/).

Install dependencies from `pubspec.yaml` by running `flutter packages get` from the project root (see [using packages documentation](https://flutter.io/using-packages/#adding-a-package-dependency-to-an-app) for details and how to do this in the editor).

There you go, you can now open & edit the project. Enjoy!
